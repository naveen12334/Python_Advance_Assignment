    "This string formatting mechanism is known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings (because of the leading f character preceding the string literal). The idea behind f-strings is to make string interpolation simpler. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign (=) inside the f-strings.\n",

This is called as shallow copy. In deep copy, new object is a copy of old object and it is created at different memory address and any changes made to new object won't be reflected in old object."
